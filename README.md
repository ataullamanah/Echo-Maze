# Echo Maze

Echo Maze is a unique maze-based puzzle game where players navigate through a randomly generated maze using sound cues instead of full visibility. The maze is mostly hidden, and players must use the "echo" mechanic to temporarily reveal nearby walls and paths. The goal is to reach the exit while avoiding traps.

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to move the player (`@`) through the maze.
- Press **'E'** to send an echo, revealing nearby cells for 1 second.
- Avoid **traps (`T`)** that reduce your health.
- Reach the **exit (`E`)** to win.
- You start with 3 health points; the game ends if health reaches 0.

## Game Features

- **Sound-Based Navigation:** Players rely on an "echo" mechanic to reveal parts of the maze, simulating echolocation.
- **Minimalist ASCII Graphics:** Uses simple text characters for a retro, lightweight feel.
- **Randomized Mazes:** Each game generates a new maze, increasing replayability.
- **Traps and Health System:** Avoid traps to preserve health and reach the exit.
